# Python S3 Uploader

This repo contains various stages of my Python S3 Uploader project. These are meant just for reference.

## Set Up

In each of the subdirectories, you need to configure a Python virtual environment. You are free to choose how/if you are going to do so, but here is my suggestion - use `venv`.

Change into the directory of your choice, and then run the following commands

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
